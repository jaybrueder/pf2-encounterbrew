# FAQ

## I like this application. Can I buy a coffee?

Yes of course. Thank you: [https://ko-fi.com/jaybrueder](https://ko-fi.com/jaybrueder)

## Can you add feature X, Y and Z?

Feature requests are always welcome. Please open an issue on GitHub and I will try to make it happen.

However, keep in mind that is a highly opinionated product and I might decided that I do not want that feature in the application.

Even better would be if you want to contribute yourself! Learn all about it here: [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Why build another encounter manager?

There are two reasons why I wanted to build this application:

1. I do not like using a laptop, or any large screen device, when running my PF2 games. I prefer to just use my phone to manage the encounter. I was missing an encounter manager that was optimized for the phone, especially on iOS, for PF2. Therefore, I built one.

2. I was looking for a project that sharpen my Go, PostgreSQL and HTMX skills. This project gave me a great opportunity to do just that.

## Why are not simply developing an Android/iOS app?

I do not own an Android smartphone, and I also do not want to pay for a Apple developers license.

I was thinking about doing this in React Native. However, I try to avoid JS whenever I can :D

## Would you consider making this a SaaS offer?

If there is enough interest, I would be willing to host this as a public web app on one of my servers.

However, before I do this it will take some time to test it in its current form and gather feedback.

## Can I run this on a VPS / local server / RaspberryPi?

Yes, I do that myself. The only dependency you need is Docker. Just run docker compose in the background:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Can you recommend me a VPS?

I am using [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) for my hosting needs and like it a lot.

## Can you set this up for me?

No. Learn about self-hosting here: (https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)
